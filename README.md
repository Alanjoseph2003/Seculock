🔐 SecuLock: Reinventing Locker Security with AI, Smart Alerts & Intrusion Detection
In a world increasingly dependent on digital convenience, physical security often lags behind. Traditional lockers — in homes, hostels, schools, and offices — still rely on keys, passwords, or fingerprint sensors, all of which are easy to lose, forge, or bypass. While many “smart” systems exist, they are often expensive, overly complex, or lack multi-layered intelligence.

Enter SecuLock — a modern, affordable, and intelligent locker system powered by AI-driven face recognition, real-time OTP verification, smart email alerts, and physical tampering detection. Built on the versatile Raspberry Pi 5, this system bridges the gap between advanced security features and everyday usability.

🚨 The Problem Today
Passwords can be guessed

Keys can be stolen

Biometric sensors can be spoofed

Most smart lockers don’t react to threats — they just fail silently

💡 What Makes SecuLock Different?
SecuLock introduces multi-layered authentication and active response mechanisms, making it more than just a lock — it’s a smart surveillance-driven guardian for your personal space.

✅ Face Recognition with DeepFace
Uses real-time camera input and deep learning to verify known users accurately.

✅ OTP Verification as a Failover
If the user isn’t recognized, a unique OTP is emailed to the registered address for manual authentication — no app required.

✅ Intruder Detection & Alerts
Wrong OTP? The system captures the intruder's image and immediately sends it via email while sounding an audible buzzer.

✅ Physical Theft Detection
Equipped with dual vibration sensors, SecuLock actively monitors for tampering. Any unauthorized movement triggers a security alert and alarm — even before the lock is opened.

✅ LCD + Keypad UI
A user-friendly interface makes it easy to operate, enter OTPs, and understand system prompts — no smartphone dependency.
